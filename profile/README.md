## NFT or NOT
NFT or NOT is a social experiment built on Lens Protocol, transforming the 2000s craze Hot-or-Not into a thrilling showdown of AI-generated images based on community prompts. Users can collect NFTs for a fee to support creators, and the highest-voted submission makes it to the Hall of Flame.

## Whisper Chain
Whisper Chain is a fun social experiment built on Lens Protocol, where users can experience the thrill of chain mutations. It is based on the classic game of Chinese whispers or telephone, where the objective is to observe how much the original seed image changes as it gets passed along the chain.

## Queue
Queue simplifies publishing and subscribing tasks over RabbitMQ by utilizing a topic-based exchange. One use case is API worker processes to publish tasks for asynchronous processing, which can then be picked up by subscribed worker processes.

## Openapi Test Suite
Openapi Test Suite simplifies the creation and maintenance of API test suites by using an Openapi.json API specification file to generate test cases automatically. This method is compatible with APIs written in any programming language, as long as the Openapi.json file is available.

Repo(s): [openapi-test-suite](https://github.com/TrueSparrowSystems/openapi-test-suite)

## Base
Base is a collection of frequently used functionalities in True Sparrow repositories, such as a custom logger, response helper, Promise QueueManager, and Instance composer. It standardizes logging and response formatting across applications, and the QueueManager provides management options and configurations for a queue of Promises. The Instance composer facilitates the sharing of config strategies across registered classes and instances.
