# About True Sparrow
True Sparrow is a boutique product development studio providing software engineering and design services. We work with clients to rapidly turn their ideas into live scalable products. We occasionally build in-house moonshots as well.

# Our Open Source Products
We not only help our clients take things from 0 to 1, but we also enjoy giving back to the community through our contributions to Open Source. Here are some of our Open Source contributions.

## UniCache
UniCache is an open-source NPM package that offers a unified and consistent interface for Memcached, Redis, and in-memory caching. It simplifies the interaction with multiple caching engines, reducing development time and effort. UniCache is also fully compatible with AWS ElastiCache for Memcached and Redis.

## Queue
Queue simplifies publishing and subscribing tasks over RabbitMQ by utilizing a topic-based exchange. One use case is API worker processes to publish tasks for asynchronous processing, which can then be picked up by subscribed worker processes.

## NFT or NOT
NFT or NOT is a social experiment built on Lens Protocol, transforming the 2000s craze Hot-or-Not into a thrilling showdown of AI-generated images based on community prompts. Users can collect NFTs for a fee to support creators, and the highest-voted submission makes it to the Hall of Flame.

## Whisper Chain
Whisper Chain is a fun social experiment built on Lens Protocol, where users can experience the thrill of chain mutations. It is based on the classic game of Chinese whispers or telephone, where the objective is to observe how much the original seed image changes as it gets passed along the chain.

## Openapi Test Suite
Openapi Test Suite simplifies the creation and maintenance of API test suites by using an Openapi.json API specification file to generate test cases automatically. This method is compatible with APIs written in any programming language, as long as the Openapi.json file is available.

## Base
Base is a collection of frequently used functionalities in True Sparrow repositories, such as a custom logger, response helper, Promise QueueManager, and Instance composer. It standardizes logging and response formatting across applications, and the QueueManager provides management options and configurations for a queue of Promises. The Instance composer facilitates the sharing of config strategies across registered classes and instances.
